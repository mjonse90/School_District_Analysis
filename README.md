# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The chief data scientist of a local, large school district has asked us to complete a complete and total analysis of their schools. The purpose is to analyze standardized math and reading test scores from each student and how it will correlate to the allocation of the school budget. 

Upon receiving the data for the analysis, it was brought to our attention that there is a high probability of fraud at Thomas High School. The school district would like our help in determining if this is true.
